# CRUNCHY ON THE OUTSIDE

These IDAPython scripts were written for the purpose of analysing a specific type of x86 code obfuscation which is sometimes applied to malicious software and needs to be removed before further analysis can take place. They are provided as-is without any guarantees that they work correctly or are fit for any particular purpose. No support is provided, but if you need these scripts you shouldn't need any support.

IDA Pro 7.1+ is required.
